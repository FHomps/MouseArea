# MouseArea
SFML-based invisible "areas" which capture mouse movements and interactions. Areas support multiple modes (clicking, toggling, holding), different mouse buttons for activation, and are tailored to SFML objects: the copyShape() and copySprite() methods copy the characteristics of a shape or sprite to fit the area around it.
